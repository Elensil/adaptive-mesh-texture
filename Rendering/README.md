## Introduction

There are several solutions for displaying models with a mesh texture.
- [LucyViewer](https://kinovis.inria.fr/lucyviewer/), a viewing software for 4D models, supports our mesh texture format in its current version (on git branch "mesh_texture")
- The [Unity](https://gitlab.inria.fr/marmando/adaptive-mesh-texture/tree/master/Rendering/Unity) folder contains ressources to load and render textured meshes in Unity.
- The [OpenGL](https://gitlab.inria.fr/marmando/adaptive-mesh-texture/tree/master/Rendering/OpenGL) folder contains shader files that can be potentially reused in other applications.
