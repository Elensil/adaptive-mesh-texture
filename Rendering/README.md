## Introduction

There are several solutions for displaying models with a mesh texture.
- [LucyViewer](https://kinovis.inria.fr/lucyviewer/), a viewing software for 4D models, supports our mesh texture format in its current version
- The [Unity]() folder contains ressources to load and render textured meshes in Unity.
- The [OpenGL]() folder contains shader files that can be potentially reused in other applications.
